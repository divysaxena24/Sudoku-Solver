# ðŸ§© Sudoku Solver in Java

A Java-based **Sudoku Solver** that uses the **Backtracking algorithm** to solve any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. This project is a great way to understand recursion, constraint satisfaction, and algorithmic problem-solving in Java.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- Implements classic **Backtracking Algorithm**
- Console-based interface
- Easy to modify and extend

## ðŸ§  How it Works

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Find an empty cell (with value 0)
2. Try placing numbers 1 through 9
3. For each number:
   - Check if it is valid (not in the same row, column, or 3x3 box)
   - If valid, place the number and recurse
   - If the recursion returns false, backtrack and try the next number
4. If all cells are filled legally, the puzzle is solved

Great for practice in recursion and backtracking
